# Brainstorming
- I want to convert a video to a transcript and parse the text for relevant recipe information. Then possiblly use OCR to fill in any blanks.
- Google Cloud Speech-To-Text or AWS Transcribe should be able to get the transcript for me 
- **Ingreedy.js** - maybe, keep looking

# things I need to Do 
- Figure out Speech-To-Text
  - Explore APIs, youtube transcript works well for youtube only, keep trying to find more.
