Something everyone should know is how to make a classic bowl of teriyaki chicken. Start with bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and carefully separate the bone from the meat, making sure that the skin stays intact. For the marinade, combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, and white pepper. Add a couple tablespoons to the chicken thighs and set this aside. At this point, you can add honey to the leftover marinade, which you don't want to add to the chicken marinade because it risks burning in the air fryer. Place the chicken with the skin side facing down and air fry for about 12 minutes, then flip and air fry for another 12 minutes. Pour the teriyaki glaze into a saucepan and let this reduce for a few minutes, then add in a starch slurry to thicken. Brush this over the chicken thighs and then you're ready to plate it all up over some jasmine rice along with some blanched broccoli and a cucumber salad.
