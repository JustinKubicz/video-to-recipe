Yo, I just made this chicken and sausage jambalaya and I don't need none of the Cajun people on my back. Let me show y'all how to get down. All right, so into my enamel cast iron pan, I got some Andouille sausages down. Cooked it up until it was nice and brown, and I set that aside. In that same skillet, I added some chicken thighs that I cut up, seasoned them with some all-purpose seasoning, and then I removed those after a few minutes as well. The heat was on medium-high, so we're gonna reduce it to medium and add in some peppers, onions, and celery. You already know the Holy Trinity. Then add some garlic, tomato paste, and a little bit of crushed tomatoes. Next, mix in about a half a cup of rice. Let everything come together, add the sausage and the chicken back, and finish it off with some chicken broth. Season it very well. Mix everything to combine and let everything come to a boil. Then turn the heat down to low and let it cook for like an additional 12 minutes. Then turn the heat off and let everything fluff. It's gonna come out looking just like this. And all you gotta do is top it off with some green onion. Quick and easy chicken and sausage jambalaya. Perfect for the non-shellfish eaters like myself. Yeah, you gotta eat it while it's hot, so you already know, it's a wrap. Let's go. *[Sound of sizzling]*
