For egg obsessed people, like my father and me, nothing could be as desirous as this rich, visually stunning meal. Here's the recipe. Eggs with tomato, serves two. One quarter cup olive oil. One medium to large onion, thinly sliced. One 28 ounce can, whole plum tomatoes. Four to six large eggs. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Warm the olive oil in a medium, non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about three minutes. Add the tomatoes, crushing them with your hand or the back of a slotted spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have sweetened, about 20 minutes. Gently break the eggs into the pan and cover. Decrease the heat to medium low and cook until the whites are opaque and the yolks are moderately firm, about five minutes. Serve immediately, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Cheers, Stanley, for this recipe. You can listen to his and other books on Audible now.
