Let's make the greatest carnitas ever. Salt. Big pot. I should also mention you can use other pots, such as a Dutch oven. That works fine. Lime. Pork. Cinnamon. Bay leaf. Very simple. Low heat, still melted, slow cook. After a couple hours. Oh yeah, yeah, that's.  Wow. Just like magic. Tomatillos. Garlic. Little salt.  Tortillas.  Baking powder. Little bit of salt. Water.  In. Ball. Good thing I got the new ARC XL. Thanks, Cosby. Now would you look at that. Well, it's a damn tortilla. What's up? White onion. Will you marry me? This is the finishing touch. Oh! Jesus. That is the greatest pork I've ever had.
