Oh, I have so little time to make dinner. Try this. It's a ros√© pasta with chicken breasts easy And really good. I don't really like cooking chicken breast whole takes too much time So what I like to do is split it in half season with salt onion and garlic paprika any other spices you want Lay them down into a really hot pan and now they're cooked after five minutes. I swear it's still juicy into the same pan Let's add some onions and garlic stir a little tomato paste milk because we're on a diet. Just kidding I'm adding cream as well. Once it comes up to a simmer. Let's add our pasta water and our pasta itself Now i'll just let this thicken and top with some parmesan
