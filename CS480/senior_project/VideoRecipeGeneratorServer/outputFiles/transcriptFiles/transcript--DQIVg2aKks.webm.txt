Let's make the best egg breakfast in the world, shakshuka. And all you need is one pan. Onions don't belong in shakshuka. We're gonna need some bell pepper. Very simply strip these down and just give them a nice dice. Now in a hot cast iron, I'm gonna drizzle lots of olive oil. Toss in your peppers and mortar and pestle. I'm gonna hit some hard-boiled with some salt. I like to turn it into a nice paste and then just add it into your pan. Once the kitchen starts to smell like love, you're gonna add in some tomato paste. Very importantly, cook that down for a couple of minutes. You could use paprika, chili powder, cumin, and oregano. We're gonna add in lots of tomatoes. Hit this with a hefty pinch of salt and optionally some sugar. Then you wanna splash in a little water and cover. And then we wanna cook this down until the tomatoes have a jammy-like consistency. Ensure you get the perfect egg every time you crack down your egg. And I like to crack it into a bowl, make a tiny little well, and then just carefully drop in your egg. Then I'm gonna cover and cook for a few minutes. The runniness of yolk is your choice. We're gonna hit it with a little bit of parsley. If you'd like to elevate it one more notch, I recommend adding some cheese. I'm gonna scoop it up with some pita bread. And as always, now, bismillah. No joke, those are some of the best eggs I have ever had.
