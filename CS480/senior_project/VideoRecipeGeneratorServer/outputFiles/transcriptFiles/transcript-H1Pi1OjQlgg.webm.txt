If you're looking for an easy recipe, try making my soy-glazed chicken rice bowl. I'm using chicken thighs today, but you can also use chicken breasts. Marinate the chicken with soy sauce, oyster sauce, black pepper, and lots of garlic. Mix together. Saute the chicken for four to five minutes or until it gets nice and brown. And the secret ingredient, Coca-Cola. Cover and let it cook for seven to eight minutes. Now look at that.
