You guys have been loving my one tray baked pastas, and today we're making a caramelized onion version. The greatest thing about this recipe is you don't have to sit over a hot stove for an hour caramelizing your onions. The oven does the work for you. When it comes out of the oven, squeeze your garlic and then add some lemon juice, greens of choice, and coconut milk. I can't describe how amazing this sauce is. Stir in your pasta, and you're ready to serve.
