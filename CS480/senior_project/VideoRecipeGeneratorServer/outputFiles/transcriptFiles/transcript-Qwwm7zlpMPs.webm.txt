Oh, hello, this is the greatest 20 minute ramen of your life. Two shallots, peeled, fine diced, in. Seven cloves garlic, fine chopped. One inch gnobe, ginger grated. Oh, that was cliche. My lord! Pan, butter, in. Melt it, brown it, little bit of corn, in. Salt to taste, stir till hot. That's a god dang brown butter corn, hot. Little bit of oil, heat medium high. Half pound ground pork, in. Sear till brown, mash that up. Oh yeah. Place to the side, oil, sesame oil. Vegetables in, saute two minutes. One tablespoon of sugar, spicy chili crisp. Add your meat back, quarter cup miso. Stir, one and a half quarts of chicken stock and one tablespoon of handashi. Once that starts to simmer, cut the heat. Water, boil, ramen, in. Drain that, broth. Your nudes, green onion, eggs. Mama? Oh!
