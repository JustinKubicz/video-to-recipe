Nine pounds of salt and a whole bottle of wine with holiday chimichurri on there. Beautiful prime rib with a huge ribeye cap. Olive oil is the binder. Cowboy butter and grass. First we reduce some red wine and we'll infuse that with rosemary and thyme. Nine pounds of salt. Cooked down red wine. Purple salt now. It's like kinetic sand. Layer on the bottom. Prime rib down. Build these kind of walls up slowly. There's an entire prime rib in there. Since we can't see it, we don't want to overcook it. That is wild. I'm the smoker. It's like a giant dinosaur egg. 125 internal. Whoa. Look at that shell. Break off the shell. Remove our prime rib.  Sear off our prime rib. Wow. Perfectly seared over fire. Rest it half an hour. Chop all this up with red wine vinegar and olive oil for a beautiful holiday chimichurri. Wall-to-wall medium rare perfection. When you can bite through a prime rib like that, it's pretty self-explanatory how tender it is. The red wine salt made it super juicy. Flavor came through, and then that holiday chimichurri is insane.
