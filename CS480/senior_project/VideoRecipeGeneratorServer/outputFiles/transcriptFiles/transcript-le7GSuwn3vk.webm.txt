Creole jambalaya is one of the top dishes in New Orleans. It's full of flavor, I'm telling y'all, it's pressure. Let's get into it. So boom, cut up your andouille sausage, then we're gonna get a different cutting board, lay out our chicken and season it with paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Remember, if you ain't sneezing, it ain't seasoned. And make sure to sanitize your work area along the way. Chop up your holy trinity of onions, bell pepper, celery, put that to the side. Go ahead and brown your sausage, take it out the pan, and then we're gonna add our chicken right in there. Cook it up on both sides, then we're gonna chop it up and add it in with the sausage. Put that to the side, then we're gonna saute our vegetables and all them drippings. I'm telling y'all, it's full of flavor. Add your garlic paste, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, and Cajun seasoning. We're gonna mix everything together and then come with buku chicken stock. Add your proteins back in, throw in some hot sauce if you want to kick it up a notch, then your bay leaves. We're gonna bring this up to a boil, reduce it to a simmer, cover it up. After a while, all them flavors are gonna be locked in together. Add in your rice, we want to bring that back to a boil, then again to a simmer. Cover it up, let that rice soak in all that flavor, mix it up, remove your bay leaves, top it with some fresh green onions, toss it up, and look at that. Yes, Lord. From there, just plate it up and just like my name, you're all done.
