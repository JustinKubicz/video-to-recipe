Our most popular recipe last year was the Marry Me Chicken. But it started in 2016, when Lindsay Funston created a chicken dish for Delish. And now there are hundreds of versions all over TikTok. It's not to be confused with Engagement Chicken, a recipe published in Glamour Magazine in 2004, which was viral before we used the word viral. Marry Me Chicken uses tomato paste, oregano, heavy cream, and sun-dried tomatoes to season boneless, skinless chicken breasts, making them worthy of wedding bells.
