Let me show you how to make some juicy and tender carnitas, only done in 30 minutes. Y'all, these were so fire. I'm about to cry. To get started, we're gonna need a pork butt. Why is it called a pork butt when it's literally the shoulder of the meat? Finally, Jesus. After we remove the bones, we're gonna cube this up. Drizzle with some olive oil and season with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, Mexican oregano, and coarse pepper and salt. Now give that a massage like you had a hard day at work. We doing this in an instant pot, I'm trying to eat now. Now we're gonna sear this. So we're gonna add some lard and then we're gonna add in our pork and let that get brown like meat. After we seared the meat, we're gonna add the other half of the lard. Yes, this is a big back meal. Then we're gonna add some Mexican Coke. Add some onions, some garlic, some bay leaves, some thyme and rosemary. Squeeze an orange like it stole money from you and shut that thing up. This only took 30 minutes. If you don't have this, you can use a slow cooker and let this cook on low for like 10 hours. Add this to a sheet tray, add some of the oil from the pot, and then we're gonna put this on broil until it's brown and crispy. And that's it. Assemble your tacos however you like, and all you gotta do is enjoy. It's two in the morning and your boy's starving. I'm about to cry.
