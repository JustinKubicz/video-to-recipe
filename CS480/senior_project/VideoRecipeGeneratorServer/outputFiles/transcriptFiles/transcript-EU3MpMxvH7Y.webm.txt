Let me show you how to make my incredible chicken alfredo recipe. Mmm, bro, that is just so good. We're using chicken breast cutlets, which just means the breast is sliced in half. Drizzle on generous amounts of oil. Season with chipotle chili powder and paprika. Hit this with some type of Italian herb blend. And then just finish with salt, pepper, garlic, and onion. And please don't be afraid to spice the life out of these. These spices are going to create all that flavor on the bottom of the pan. When your pan is nice and hot, drizzle in a little bit more oil. And then our beautiful chicken goes in. And please don't be afraid of a nice char. This is not burnt, this is flavor. Now in the same flavored pan, go in with lots of onions. Make sure you scrape that pan to unlock all that flavor. Lots of minced heartburn. Yes, to my Italians, we know that traditional alfredo only contains three ingredients. And this is obviously not traditional. Thanks for the inspo, bitch. Time to go in with some grass-fed butter so it's healthy. When that melts, heavy cream it. Throw in all those cooking juices of the rested chicken. And then it's time to go in with lots of Italian snow. The only salt I add is in the pasta water and on the chicken at the beginning. When your fettuccine is almost done, add it to the sauce. And just watch it slowly soak up all that sauce. Throw your blackened chicken on top and hit it with some parsley flakes. And as always, now bismillah.
