Let's make Hungarian goulash, my friends. This is one of the most popular soups in the world with lots of paprika. First things first, and add a bit of olive oil. And here I have a little over two pounds of cubed beef chuck, and we'll season that with salt and pepper. Then sear the beef in batches. Transfer the browned beef to a plate, and we'll reduce the heat a bit. And here I have one large onion, chopped. Next, we'll take the pot off the heat and we'll stir in a quarter cup of paprika. All right, return the pot to heat, and add some garlic, two bell peppers, chopped, and two medium tomatoes, chopped, caraway seeds, three cups of beef broth, and two bay leaves, and a bit of salt and pepper. Simmer it for about an hour and a half. Three large potatoes, chopped, two large carrots, chopped, and we can add a little bit more liquid here to make sure it's more of a soup. Cover and simmer for a good 20 minutes. Look at that Hungarian goulash. Looks amazing, isn't it? Yum.
