Let me show you a 20 minute meal that will guarantee you a second date. Unless they're allergic to miso, in which case this is not gonna do any good for you. Starting with some thick pork belly. You actually don't want it that thick, just thick enough to satisfy. Now finely dice some garlic and some shallot. And that's it, there's literally no other prep. Now add your pork belly to a cold pan. Well, it was supposed to be cold. Give it a little bit of salt and then let it slowly render out. And once it starts to get crispy, carefully remove. Now add your butter, followed closely by your garlic and shallots, and let this ride on a medium heat until your butter is nicely browned. And once you've got it browned, go ahead and add in your miso. And if you wanna know what brand I use, I like on sale. A little bit of soy sauce. And once that's all nicely mixed together, remove it from the heat and boil your noods. We're gonna ladle in a little bit of that noodle water and then add in your noods. Now just toss back in your pork belly and squeeze on just a little bit of lemon juice.
