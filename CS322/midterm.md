* compare and contrast scope and extent
    * Scop is the context
    * Extent is the lifetime

* Contour diagrams

* activation diagrams

* lexical and dynamic scops

* a type in a formal language is a set of values

* dynamic typing is easier for prototyping
* first class objects, nothing to do with object oriented programming, functions are first class objects, can be passed as an arg, assigned to a var, or returned from a function

* grammar of lambda, chart at the top of lecture page 
    * lambda is left associative
    * a parameter is bound when a lambda is associated with it
    * know the alpha, beta, eta rules
        * alpha- bound parameter may be renamed
        * beta - replace occurences of a bound parameter with an applied value
        * eta - a lambda binding ay be fropped if there are no occurences of the bound parameter
    * context free grammars

        * sequence of variables and terminals is a production


* finite state machines
    * A = (Q, Sigma, Delta, q0, F)
    * Q = a finite set of states
    * Sigma - is a finite set of symbols (alphabet)
    * delta is a transition function
    * q0 is the start state
    * F is a set of final or accepting states
    * the language of a finite state machine, is the set of all strings such that delta hat takes you from the start state to the final state
* Regular Expressions
    * A symbol from the alphabet is a regular expression
    * the five rules of regex

* JavaScript
